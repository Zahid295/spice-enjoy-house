## Design

### Font

The Spice Enjoy House web app utilizes the Arial font, a classic and widely-used typeface. This font was chosen for its clean, easy-to-read, and versatile characteristics, making it an ideal fit for a restaurant booking website. Arial is used for both the headings and the body to maintain consistency and readability across the site. For the h1 tags, a larger font size is employed to make them stand out and grab attention. This font selection not only pleases the eye but also aligns well with the restaurant market.
